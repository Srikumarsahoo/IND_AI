This command will run the `app.main:app` module from your Python file with the `--reload` option, which automatically reloads the app when changes are made.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `uvicorn`: This is the command-line tool for the Uvicorn ASGI server.\n- `app.main:app`: This is the Python module and the specific application instance to run. In your Python file, you should have something like this: `app = FastAPI()` for a FastAPI app, or `app = WebApplication.factory(ApplicationFactory())` for a Starlette app.\n- `--reload`: This option tells Uvicorn to watch for changes in your code and automatically reload the server when changes are detected. This is an efficient way to develop and test your app locally.\n\nJust make sure your Python file is correctly named (e.g., `app.py`) and saved in the correct directory before running this command in your terminal or command prompt."
